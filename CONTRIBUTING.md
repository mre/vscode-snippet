# Contributing

This plugin is far from feature-complete.  
If you want to improve it, feel free to pick one of the [open issues](https://github.com/mre/vscode-snippet/issues) and give it a shot.  
In case you need any help, just add a comment to the issue to get a conversation started. :smiley:

## Dev setup

Open this repo in VSCode, and you should be able to just Start the launch task "Launch Extension":

You might need to wait a moment for the first `npm install` to finish. You can see progress in the "running build tasks" section of VSCode:

### additional commands
To get a list of all available commands, try `make help`.  
To test your changes, go to the Debug panel in VSCode and click on the `play` button. This will start the extension in a new window where you can test it.
